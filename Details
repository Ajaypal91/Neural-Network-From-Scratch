There are three different implementations of Neural Network from scratch which uses backpropagation and gradient Descent.

DATASET USED: The dataset used is moons dataset provided in sklear library of python

Part 1) Contains mini-batch gradient descent
Part 2) uses the annealing schedule to change the value of epsilon 
Part 3) uses sigmoidal activation function istead of tanh which is used in other examples.

The loss function is printed at each iteration and in the end the graph is plotted for model build on the moons dataset.
